This repository contains the codes used to automate the reminder emails
for Campus Observatory at NMSU. To use it, a few things need to be changed:

1) Get everyone signed up in a Google spreadsheet. The format of this is 
    critcal for the scripts to work, so reuse an old sheet. Download it
    as a csv file and change the  variable singup to the name of the Google sheet. 
2) Get a copy of the contact information, called astroContact.csv, from:
    /home/users/jrvander/astroContact.csv. 
3) Make sure everyone is signed up with their actual name. If you're curious
    about which names are okay, check the astroContact.csv file.
4) Download a copy of the repository to your local system and change the variable
    loc in reminders.sh to this location. 
5) Make sure astroContacts.csv is up to date with any new students
6) Change objects.csv to the objects for this semester and the correct start and
    end dates for each half
7) Untar the weather-2.0.tar.gz file in this directory
8) Set up the cron job. This will run the script at 10 AM every Monday and Wednesday
    a) On the command line, run crontab -e
    b) This will open an editor to edit you cron tab.
    c) Type in: 
        00 10 * * 1,3 <location of the scripts>/reminders.sh

That should do it.
